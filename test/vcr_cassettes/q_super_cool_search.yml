        a period of rapid progress with long-held convictions being shown to be incomplete.
        While these stars are relatively few in numbers, they are the main driver
        of chemical and dynamical evolution in galaxies through their stellar winds
        and explosive deaths in core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore the impact of
        massive stars is widely recognized in many areas, as they are often used as
        tools to interpret the conditions and processes arising in different environments.
        In parallel, the development of new instrumentation, analysis techniques and
        dedicated surveys across all possible wavelengths have delivered large amounts
        of exquisite new data. These data are now providing a harsh test for the current
        state-of-the-art theoretical calculations of massive star birth, evolution
        and death. Aspects of massive stars discussed include supernovae, stellar
        evolution, stellar properties, and stellar populations."],"format":["SCI","NET"],"literary_form":"nonfiction","related_items":[{"kind":"in
